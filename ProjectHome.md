This Project should feature:

- Filesharing in a small Friend to Friend Network
- Using Mail as a Connector (similar to a Tracker, but way easier to use and you can choose your server yourself)
- On as much plattform as possible. Start will be with Mac, Windows, Linux, Maemo, Symbian^3, MeeGo. We will also try to develop this application for Android and/or iPhone (iPhone not sure, cause of Apples... strange company policy)
